<h1>My top movies as of recently</h1>
<h2>These three are for sure 10/10</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
<p>I love this movie so much because it consists of such a range of emotions and provokes deep thought while also being incredibly random in such a cohesive manner.</p>
<h3>Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>Need I say more? This movie is a literal iteraion of a comic book.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I love the sci-fi in this movie as well as the score.</p>
